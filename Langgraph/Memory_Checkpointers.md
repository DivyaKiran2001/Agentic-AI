### Memory and CheckPointers :

### CheckPointers :

A CheckPointer in LangGraph is essentially a way to save the state of your agent or workflow at specific points during execution

- Checkpoints save the complete state after a node finishes its work
- If an error occurs in a later node, you can resume from the last checkpoint rather than starting
- the entire workflow again

### Thread ID :

A thread ID is simply a unique identifier for each specific conversation or workflow execution.
